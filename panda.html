            <p>
                The <strong>giant panda</strong> is a bear native to the mountain ranges of south-central China. It is easily recognized by its large, distinctive black patches around its eyes, over the ears, and across its round body. Though it belongs to the order Carnivora, the panda's diet is over 99% bamboo. They are skilled climbers and can also swim. Due to farming, deforestation, and other development, the giant panda has been driven out of the lowland areas where it once lived, and it is a conservation-reliant vulnerable species.
