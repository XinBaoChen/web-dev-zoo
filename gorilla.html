                <strong>Gorillas</strong> are the largest living primates and are native to the forests of equatorial Africa. They are ground-dwelling, predominantly herbivorous apes that display a high level of intelligence and complex social structures. A group of gorillas, called a troop, is led by a dominant adult male known as a "silverback," who is responsible for protecting the family. There are two species: the eastern gorilla and the western gorilla, both of which are sadly endangered due to habitat loss, poaching, and disease.
