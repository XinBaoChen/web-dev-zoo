                The <strong>African elephant</strong> is the largest land animal on Earth, recognized by its large ears that are shaped much like the continent of Africa. These gentle giants live in herds and are found in the savannas, forests, and woodlands of sub-Saharan Africa. They are highly intelligent and social animals with complex family structures led by a matriarch. Their diet is entirely herbivorous, consisting of roots, grasses, fruit, and bark. Unfortunately, African elephants are a vulnerable species, facing significant threats from poaching for their ivory tusks and habitat loss.
