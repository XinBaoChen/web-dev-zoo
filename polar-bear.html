              <!-- Animal description -->
                The <strong>polar bear</strong> is the world's largest land carnivore and is uniquely adapted for life in the harsh Arctic environment. Its native range includes the Arctic Ocean, its surrounding seas, and land masses.
                 Polar bears have a thick layer of body fat and a water-repellent coat that insulates them from the cold air and water. They are talented swimmers and primarily hunt seals from the edge of sea ice. 
                 Due to the ongoing loss of their sea ice habitat from climate change, polar bears are classified as a vulnerable species.
